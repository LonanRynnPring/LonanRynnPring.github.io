            I will design a couple of different layouts on paper and see which one I prefer, I will also be researching different html and css functions that I can include in my website. I will try out each function and see which ones I like and which I don't<br><br>
            I will be using trello to visually show my progress, including what I still have to do, what I am currently doing and what I have done. I will label each trello card with what I need to use to complete the task.

            Digital projects failing is a big issue, there is a massive demand for digital solutions and as a result there are lots of digital projects being started that arenâ€™t thoroughly thought through. Somewhere between 70% and 90% of digital projects fail. Interestingly digital projects tend to fail for simple reasons, despite how often they fail. The main reason for digital projects not succeeding is that digital projects require significant collaboration and that is often underestimated. If your team is not collaborating then you have no chance of completing a coherent project.<a href="#ref3"><sup>[3]</sup></a><a href="#ref4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>

                Start by researching different kinds of IT systems and software that are available, you can do this by  finding out what similar projects have used and what is available on the marketplace.
                For creating a blog decide whether you want to create it online using an online blog editor like wordpress or if you want to create it using an editor like visual studio code which is done offline and you would upload it afterwards. Select the right project management tools for your team if you need a collaborative tool you can use Trello, if you need a communication tool you can use Slack, if you need a time management tool you can use Toggl.

            I have chosen to use Trello to manage my project timeline. I am using Kanban principles to keep me up to date with what I have left to do, what I am currently working on, and what I have finished. I am also using trello to label my tasks with what I need to use to complete them, for example will I be using html, CSS or is it a research task. Trello also helps lets me know how much time I have left to do each task. I am also using Toggl to manage my time, Toggl lets me set a stopwatch on each task so I know how much time I am spending on each part of the project.

            A simple dice game where the object is to roll the dice and add up your score until you get 20. However if you roll a 1 you have to restart. It is my first look at using javascript and the DOM together.

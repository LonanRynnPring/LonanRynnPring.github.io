                The first page is going to be the home page. At the top of the page there will be a navigation bar that links to the other pages, the buttons will be images which will also be used as the background for the page (altered slightly). Below that will be heading and an about me section, then there will be a photo of me. At the bottom of the page will be a section about codenation.
<br><br>
                The second page will have the same navigation bar at the top, underneath that will be a menu of jump links to the different sections of this page. There will be subheadings and paragraphs on each of the unit 1 outcome 1 questions. At the bottom of the page there will be a “back to top” button that will always be visible. The third page will have the same layout as page 2 with the content of unit 2 outcome 1.

                Copyright laws will affect the images I use, I will have to make sure I search for images that are labeled for reuse. I will also have to reference any webpages that I get info from for the content on page 1. The first copyright Act of Parliament was the Statute of Anne in 1709, it allowed writers to choose who could copy their work for a period of 14 years. They could also decide what to charge for copies of their work. This was because of a bigger concern of protecting your work from people using, printing and selling copies of others work in greater numbers for a profit.<a href="#ref1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>

            People who are blind or who have sight issues may struggle to read any written content of a webpage, to overcome this we can implement a text to speech function that would read out the written content of a page and describe any images or other visual content. Most devices have a text-to-speech function, so we would just have to write a script to access it for our webpage.

            Also to help with sight issues and general comprehension it is important to choose a good font and a large font size. The colour of the font and the background is important too, if the colours clash it would be harder to read.

        <h3>HTML Accessibility</h3>
        <p>
            It is good practice to write your HTML code with accessibility in mind. Your aim is to provide the user a good way to navigate and utilise your webpage. Semantic HTML is the practice of using correct HTML elements for their correct purpose as much as you can. Semantic elements are elements with a meaning, e.g. using the button element instead of a div element for a button. This give context to a screen reader and thus the webpage is more accessible to people using a screen reader. 
            Semantic HTML is also accessible for people using keyboard only navigation, it can be accessed using the tab key.
                        
        </p>
        <p>
            Screen readers also read the alt attribute for images, so if you describe what the image is in the alt attribute people using a screen reader will know what it shows.
            Use language that is easy to understand and easily readable by a screen reader, for example avoid using dashes, instead of writing 1-5, write 1 to 5.<a href="#ref2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>

            There are lots of file types you can use for websites. For images there are, PNG JPG GIF and SVG. They all serve different purposes.A <abbr title="Joint Photographic Experts Group">JPG</abbr> is good for real life images and they are compressed which means it’ll be a small file. <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIFs</abbr> are good for animation, they only accommodate up to 256 index colours and as a result are very small files, they are good for adding motion to your website. <abbr title="Portable Network Graphics">PNGs</abbr> can be animated like GIFs and they can support up to 16 million colours like JPGs, as a result they are much more detailed and are often bigger files. They also support transparency. <abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVGs</abbr> are drawn mathematically and not with pixels unlike the others, they tend to be larger files than the other types but are also the most detailed. <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> is used for the content of a webpage, splitting the page into Headings, paragraphs of text and images. <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> is used for styling the HTML however you want, giving it colour, borders, layout, etc.<a href="#ref3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>
